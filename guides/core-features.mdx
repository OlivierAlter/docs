## Interacting with Your Apps

### AppSense - Understanding Your Mac

Unlike traditional screen capture methods, AppSense reads actual data directly from macOS applications, allowing Alter to access information beyond what's visible on your screen.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deep Integration" icon="plug">
    Access app data, not just screenshots
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Awareness" icon="brain">
    Understand what you're working on automatically

</CardGroup>

#### Current Application

Alter automatically suggests using your active window as context:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Look for the suggestion">
    Click **Current Application** below the prompt box
  </Step>
  <Step title="Or use keyboard">
    Press `↓` then `Enter` to select it

## Follow Mode

Follow Mode is a core feature of Alter that enables real-time synchronization of data from your active applications, documents, and files during chat sessions.

### How It Works
