title: "Custom Models Not Showing"
description: "Fix missing OpenAI, Mistral, or local models in the model selector"
---

<Note>
  **Important:** You need an API key from your provider (OpenAI, Mistral, etc.) before they will appear in Alter.
</Note>

## What's happening?

You've added your API key, but when you press `/` to see models:
- The **Custom** section is empty
- You don't see your provider's models
- You only see Alter Cloud models

## Common setup mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="toggle-off" title="Custom Provider is turned off">
    Even with an API key entered, you need to enable custom providers:
    
    1. Open Alter Settings (`Cmd + ,`)
    2. Go to **API Keys** tab
    3. Find **Custom Provider** section
    4. Toggle **Enable Custom Provider** to ON
    5. You should see a ✓ next to "Custom Endpoint"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="link" title="Wrong endpoint format (especially for Azure)">
    **For most providers:** Just paste your API key – the endpoint is automatic
    
    **For Azure specifically**, you need the full URL:
    ```
    https://your-instance.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/your-model-name/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-15-preview
    ```
    
    Make sure your URL includes:
    - Your instance name
    - The deployment name
    - The api-version parameter
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Invalid or expired API key">
    Quick checks:
    - Did you copy the full key? (They usually start with `sk-`)
    - Has the key expired?
    - Do you have billing set up with the provider?
    - Did you accidentally include extra spaces?
    
    Try generating a new key from your provider's dashboard.
