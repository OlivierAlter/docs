title: "Keyboard Shortcut Not Working"
description: "Fix hotkey issues when Alt+Space or your custom shortcut won't open Alter"
---

<Note>
  **First, check the basics:** Is Alter actually running? Look for the Alter icon in your menu bar at the top of your screen.
</Note>

## What's happening?

You press your keyboard shortcut (default is `Alt + Space`), but:
- Nothing happens at all
- The quick menu doesn't appear
- It works in some apps but not others

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Problem: Shortcut was changed">
    **Solution:** Check what your shortcut is actually set to
    
    1. Open Alter (click the menu bar icon if needed)
    2. Press `Cmd + ,` to open Settings
    3. Go to the **Defaults** tab
    4. Look at **Open notch keybinding** – this shows your current shortcut
    5. Press `Alt + Space` (or your preferred combo) to set it
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="xmark" title="Problem: Another app is using the same shortcut">
    **Solution:** Find the conflict and change it
    
    Common apps that use `Alt + Space`:
    - Alfred
    - Raycast
    - Spotlight (sometimes)
    - Language switchers
    
    **Try a different shortcut:**
    - `Cmd + Shift + A`
    - `Ctrl + Option + Space`
    - `Fn + F12`
    
    Pick something you can easily remember and that no other app uses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Problem: Permissions issue">
    **Solution:** Check Accessibility permissions
    
    Alter needs Accessibility permission to detect global hotkeys:
    
    1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
    2. Make sure **Alter** is in the list and enabled
    3. If it's grayed out, click the lock icon and enter your password
    4. Toggle Alter off, then back on
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick test

After making changes:
1. Click into any app (like Safari or Notes)
2. Press your shortcut (`Alt + Space` or whatever you set)
3. **Success:** The Alter notch/quick panel should appear immediately

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** You can also open Alter by hovering your mouse over the notch at the top of your screen. This bypasses keyboard shortcuts entirely!
