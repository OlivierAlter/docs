Follow these steps to preview the Alter documentation locally and contribute changes.

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the repository">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wearedevx/alter-docs.git
cd alter-docs/docs
```
</Step>

<Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

A local preview of the documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port using the `--port` flag:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

## Validating links

Check for broken links before submitting changes:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## AI-Assisted Writing

Set up your AI coding tool to work with Mintlify:

```bash
npx skills add https://mintlify.com/docs
```

This installs Mintlify's documentation skill for AI tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.

## Deployment

Changes are deployed automatically when merged to the main branch via GitHub integration.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.
