# AGENTS.md

Read `ALTER.md` first.

This file is a thin pointer for agent runtimes that look for `AGENTS.md`.

## Required

1. Load and follow all rules in `ALTER.md` before making changes.
2. Apply repository structure, quality, assets, and commit rules from `ALTER.md`.
3. Use Mintlify conventions: MDX files with YAML frontmatter, local asset references.
4. For Mintlify product knowledge (components, configuration, writing standards),
   install the Mintlify skill: `npx skills add https://mintlify.com/docs`
