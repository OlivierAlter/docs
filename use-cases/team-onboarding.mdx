<Info>
  **Perfect for:** Team leads, managers, and organizations where multiple people need to use Alter consistently.
</Info>

## The Challenge

You have a great Alter setup:
- Custom Actions for your team's workflows
- Carefully configured settings
- Shared workspaces with important files
- Specific models that work best for your tasks

But every time someone new joins, they have to figure it all out from scratch. They:
- Use the wrong models
- Don't know about your custom Actions
- Recreate work you've already done
- Make inconsistent outputs

## The Solution: Share Your Setup

Alter makes it easy to share configurations so new team members can be productive on day one.

## Step-by-step team onboarding

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a baseline configuration">
    Document your team's standard settings:
    - **Recommended model** (e.g., "Use Claude for code review, Gemini for creative tasks")
    - **Default temperature** (e.g., 0.7 for balanced creativity)
    - **Voice hotkey** (standardize on `Fn` or a custom key)
    - **File naming conventions** for workspaces
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build starter workspaces">
    Create shared workspaces with common context:
    - **Codebase workspace:** Include your main project folders
    - **Documentation workspace:** Include specs, requirements, style guides
    - **Knowledge base workspace:** Include past decisions, FAQs, wikis
    
    <Tip>
      Workspaces are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Alter/Workspaces/`. You can share the `.alterworkspace` files directly or document how to create them.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share custom Actions">
    Export your team's most useful Actions:
    1. Open **Action Editor** (from the menu bar)
    2. Select an Action
    3. Click **Export** (or press `Cmd + E`)
    4. Save the `.json` file
    5. Share it with your team
    
    New members can import these with `Cmd + O` in the Action Editor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a team profile template">
    Share a Profile description template new members can paste into Settings > Profile:
    
    ```
    Role: [Job title]
    Team: [Team name]
    Communication style: [Direct/casual/formal]
    
    Common tools we use:
    - GitHub repo: [URL]
    - Project management: [Linear/Asana/Jira]
    - Documentation: [Notion/Confluence]
    
    Technical context:
    - Primary language: [Python/JavaScript/etc]
    - Framework: [React/Django/etc]
    - Key dependencies: [List main libraries]
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: How a dev team uses this

**The Setup:**
- **Standard model:** Claude Sonnet for most tasks
- **Code review Action:** Pre-configured to check for security issues, tests, and documentation
- **Shared workspace:** Main codebase + API documentation + deployment guides
- **Team profile:** Everyone includes the GitHub repo structure and key dependencies

**The Result:**
When a new developer joins:
1. They install Alter
2. Import the team's Actions (5 minutes)
3. Clone the shared workspace (2 minutes)  
4. Paste the profile template (1 minute)
5. They're immediately productive – they can ask "How does the auth system work?" and get contextual answers

## Making it stick

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="refresh" title="Weekly refinement sessions">
    Spend 15 minutes each week reviewing:
    - Which Actions are people using?
    - What prompts work best?
    - What's confusing new members?
    
    Update your shared resources based on feedback.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Create a team chat channel">
    Have a dedicated channel (Slack/Discord) for:
    - Sharing useful prompts
    - Posting new Actions
    - Asking "How do I...?" questions
    - Celebrating wins ("Alter just saved me 2 hours!")
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="book" title="Maintain a team playbook">
    Document your Alter setup in your team wiki:
    - Link to exported Actions
    - Instructions for setting up workspaces
    - Best practices for your domain
    - Common mistakes to avoid
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
